<H3>The Pronouns <I>si</I> and <I>se</I></H3>

The Italian pronoun <I>si</I> has several functions:
<UL>
<LI>It plays the role of the third person reflexive pronoun, regardless of whether the
subject is in the singular or in the plural. For example, ``She washes herself" and
"They wash themselves"  translate as <I>Si lava</I> and <I>Si lavano</I>, respectively.
(Note that <I>si guardavano</I> could be translated as either "They looked at themselves"
or "They looked at each other". If one wishes to make it clear that the latter is intended,
one can say <I>Si guardavano l'uno a l'altro</I>.)
<LI>It can be used in a special kind of passive construction. For example, "Houses are sold"
can be translated as <I>Si vendono case</I>.
<LI>It can be used to form an "impersonal" phrase. For example, "One must eat every day"
can be translated as <I>Si deve mangiare ogni giorno</I>. (Note that, if an adjective is
involved, it is put into the plural. For example, "One must be careful" translates as
<I>Si deve stare attenti</I>.)
</UL>

The Spanish pronoun <I>se</I> works in a similar way:
<UL>
<LI>Reflexive: "She washes herself" and "They wash themselves"  become
<I>Se lava</I> and <I>Se lavan</I>, respectively. (Again, "They looked at each other"
translates as <I>Se miraban, el uno al otro</I>.)
<LI>Passive: "Houses are sold" becomes <I>Se venden casas</I>.
<LI>Impersonal: "One must eat every day" becomes <I>Se debe comer cada
d&iacute;a</I>.
</UL>

However, <I>se</I>  has an additional function in Spanish. It arises when one has
a direct object pronoun and an indirect object pronoun in the same phrase.
For example, "She has given it to him" would become "(ella) se lo ha dado".
This does not occur in Italian: the analogous phrase would be "(lei) gliel'ha dato".
