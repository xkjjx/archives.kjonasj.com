<H3>Auxiliary Verbs</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Spanish has the complication of two verbs meaning 'to be', namely,
<I>ser</I> and <I>estar</I>. The first is used mainly for permanent
states, whereas the second is used mainly for temporary states.
The equivalent verbs <I>essere</I> and <I>stare</I> exist in Italian, but
<I>stare</I> is used much less frequently than <I>estar</I>. Compare the
Italian <I>Dov'&egrave?</I> and <I>Sono stanco</I> with the Spanish
<I>&iquest;D&oacute;nde est&aacute;?</I> and <I>Estoy cansado</I>.
<LI>Italian use of <I>stare</I> follows Spanish, however, in the construction
of the gerund (see below) and also in a few set phrases
(compare <I>Sto bene</I> with <I>Estoy bien</I>).
<LI>The main verb in Italian meaning 'to have' is <I>avere</I>. In Spanish
it is <I>tener</I>. However, whereas Italian uses <I>avere</I> to form
compound tenses, Spanish does not use <I>tener</I>. Instead, Spanish has
the special auxiliary verb <I>haber</I>.
<LI>To say 'there is', 'there are' in Italian, use <I>ci</I> plus
<I>essere</I>. For example, <I>c'&egrave una macchina</I>, <I>ci sono delle
donne</I>, <I>c'era molta gente</I>. In Spanish, you just use <I>haber</I>.
For example, <I>hay un coche</I>, <I>hay unas mujeres</I>,
<I>hab&iacute;a mucha gente</I>.
<LI>Italian has three main modal auxiliary verbs: <I>dovere</I>, <I>potere</I>
and <I>volere</I>. One can use some other verbs, such as <I>sapere</I>, as modals.
There are also several impersonal verbs, such as <I>bastare</I>, <I>bisognare</I>,
<I>convenire</I> that behave as modals.
<LI>Spanish also has the three modal verbs <I>deber</I>, <I>poder</I> and
<I>querer</I>. However, in Spanish it is common to use <I>tener que</I> in place
of <I>deber</I>. (This is similar to the English 'to have to'.) Impersonal verbs
include <I>haber que</I> and <I>hacer falta</I>.
<LI>It should be noted that the Spanish modal <I>querer</I> followed by
a person or animal means 'to love'. (To express a similar sentiment in Italian,
one can use <I>volere bene (a qualcuno)</I>.)
<LI> For more on the auxiliary verbs <I>essere</I>, <I>avere</I> and
<I>haber</I>, see the page on compound tenses.
