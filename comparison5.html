<H3>Articles</H3>

<LI>Articles are much more complicated in Italian than in Spanish.
<LI>In both languages, the indefinite articles are <I>un</I> (masculine)
and <I>una</I> (feminine). However, in Italian, <I>un</I> becomes
<I>uno</I> before a noun beginning with 's'+consonant, as in
<I>uno studente</I>, and in a few other cases. Also, 
<I>una</I> becomes <I>un'</I> before a noun beginning with a vowel,
as in <I>un' universit&agrave;</I>.
<LI>In Italian, the definite articles are <I>il</I> (masculine singular),
<I>i</I> (masculine plural), <I>la</I> (feminine singular) and
<I>le</I> (feminine plural). The Spanish equivalents are
<I>el</I>, <I>los</I>, <I>la</I> and <I>las</I> respectively.
However, in Italian, <I>il</I> becomes
<I>lo</I> before 's' + consonant and <I>l'</I>
before a vowel, <I>la</I> becomes <I>l'</I> before a vowel,
and <I>i</I> becomes <I>gli</I> before 's' + consonant or a vowel.
<LI>The only change of this kind in Spanish is that <I>la</I>
becomes <I>el</I> before a stressed 'a', as in
<I>el agua</I>, <I>el &aacute;guila</I>.
<LI>Generally speaking, Italian uses articles more frequently than Spanish.
For example, 'Do you have another pen?' is <I>Hai un'altra penna?</I> in
Italian, but simply <I>&iquest;Tienes otro boli?</I> in Spanish.
There are exceptions, however: 'on the right' is <I>a destra</I> in
Italian but <I>a la derecha</I> in Spanish.
<LI>Also, Italian has the so-called 'partitive article' construction, but
Spanish does not. For example 'I'd like some water' is <I>Vorrei dell'acqua</I>
in Italian but simply <I>Querr&iacute;a agua</I> in Spanish.
