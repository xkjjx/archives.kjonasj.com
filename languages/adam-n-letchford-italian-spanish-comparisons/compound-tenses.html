<H3>Compound Tenses</H3>

In Italian, the compound tenses are formed by taking the appropriate form
of the auxiliary verb <I>avere</I> (to have) or <I>essere</I> (to be),
followed by the past participle. Most verbs take <I>avere</I>, but all
reflexive verbs and most intransitive verbs take <I>essere</I>. When
<I>essere</I> is used, the ending of the past participle must agree
with the gender and number of the subject.<P>

Spanish is much simpler. There is a single auxiliary verb, <I>haber</I>,
and there is no agreement necessary.<P>

Italian also has the so-called 'preceding direct object pronoun' rule.
That is, the ending of the past participle must agree with a direct
object pronoun if that pronoun precedes the verb. For example,
'I have seen it' becomes <I>L'ho vista</I>, if 'it' refers to something
feminine. Spanish does not have this rule, so the sentence becomes simply
<I>La he visto</I>.<P>

Here are the five compound tenses, in the same order as their simple
counterparts:

<H4>Perfect:</H4>

(In English, 'I have eaten' and so on.) Formed by present tense of
auxiliary + past participle.<BR>

Examples: <I>ho mangiato/he comido</I>, <I>sei andata/has ido</I>,
<I>si sono alzati/se han levantado</I>.

<H4>Pluperfect:</H4>

(In English, 'I had eaten' and so on.) Formed by imperfect tense of
auxiliary + past participle.<BR>

Examples: <I>avevo mangiato/hab&iacute;a comido</I>,
<I>eri andata/hab&iacute;as ido</I>,
<I>si erano alzati/se hab&iacute;an levantado</I>.

<H4>Past anterior:</H4>

No real equivalent in English. Used for remote past and rarely used.
Formed by simple past tense of auxiliary + past participle.<BR>

Examples: <I>ebbi mangiato/hube comido</I>,
<I>fosti andata/hubiste ido</I>,
<I>si furono alzati/se hubieron levantado</I>.

<H4>Future perfect:</H4>

(In English, 'I will have eaten' and so on.)
Formed by future tense of auxiliary + past participle.<BR>

Examples: <I>avr&ograve; mangiato/habr&eacute; comido</I>,
<I>sarai andata/habr&aacute;s ido</I>,
<I>si saranno alzati/se habr&aacute;n levantado</I>.

<H4>Conditional perfect:</H4>

(In English, 'I would have eaten' and so on.)
Formed by conditional tense of auxiliary + past participle.<BR>

Examples: <I>avrei mangiato/habr&iacute;a comido</I>,
<I>saresti andata/habr&iacute;as ido</I>,
<I>si sarebbero alzati/se habr&iacute;an levantado</I>.<P>
