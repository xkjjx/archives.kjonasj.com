<H3>The Gerund</H3>

The use and formation of the gerund is similar in both languages.
In both Italian and Spanish, one uses <I>-ando</I> for first
conjugation verbs, as in <I>parlando</I>, <I>hablando</I>.
Italian uses <I>-endo</I> for second and third conjugation verbs,
whereas Spanish uses <I>-iendo</I> (compare <I>vendendo</I> and
<I>partendo</I> with <I>vendiendo</I> and <I>partiendo</I>).<P>

The gerund is normally preceded by the appropriate form of
<I>stare/estar</I>. E.g., <I>Sto parlando</I>, <I>Estoy hablando</I>.<P>

There is an important difference, however, between the two languages.
In Italian, the gerund always applies to the subject and never
to the object. Therefore, a sentence like <I>l'ho visto fumando</I>
means that I saw him while <I>I</I> (the subject) was smoking.
In Spanish, however, the gerund can apply to the object in certain
contexts. The sentence <I>lo vi fumando</I> would normally be
interpreted to mean that <I>he</I> (the subject) was smoking.
