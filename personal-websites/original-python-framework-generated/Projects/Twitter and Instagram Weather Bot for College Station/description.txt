The Twitter and Instagram Weather Bot is definitely the most complex project I have worked on. My application first makes an API call to the Open Weather API, getting weather information for College Station Texas. Then, it crafts an interesting text message that conveys this infomation. Then, depedning on the time of day and weather conditions, the program picks two background pictures - one portrait for Instagram, and one Landscape for Twitter. For example, if it is night and clear, then the program randlomly picks pictures that reflects these conditions. The pillow library is then used to write the weather and time infromation onto these pictures, after which the respective pictures along with the text message are posted to Instagram and Twitter using their respective APIs. In addition, an email is drafted both to and from my email account - cstatweather@gmail.com that updates me that the post is succesfully made.
This python program is run continuosly using a bash script on my raspberry pi that randlomly chooses a number between 25000 and 35000 everytime. This number represents the number of seconds the raspberry pi sleeps till it runs the program again, meaning the whole process is automated. I will provide the links to the respective accounts below:
