Website File Downloader

The website file downloader is a simple project that I built out of necessity. Browsing through my professor's class pages, I found that a single page had many notes and resources that would be too tedious to download on their own. With this app, this process is automated, and the downloads are all stored neatly in a separate folder in the User's Downloads folder.
</p><p>
The development of this app can be roughly divided into three parts - the development of the code, the development of the GUI, and then the compilation of the GUI into an app.
</p><p>
The code development process was relatively easy - I wrote python code that utilized the urllib library to send a get request. After getting the source file, I simply looked for anywhere in the file, where the extensions were mentioned. Say the user was looking for pdfs and a pdf was found, I backtracked to find a quotation mark. This is because links to other websites are enclosed in quotes. By going from the extension to the first occurance of quotations, I am able to get the link to the file in question. Then, I simply send a HTTP request to that file's address and save the infromation.
</p><p>
The next stage is developing the GUI, which utilized Python's Tkinter library. I also utilized ChatGPT to develop a template that I could improve on. After a succesful GUI was developed, I was able to use pyinstaller, another tool, to compile the Tkinter code to an app. This app succesfully runs when I click on it, just like any professionally developed app - I have not went through the process of giving it an icon yet, however.
