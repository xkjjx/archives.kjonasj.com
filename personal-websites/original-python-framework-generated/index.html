<p>
I am a Computer Engineering major at Texas A&M University with plenty of experience in a wide variety of fields. My electrical engineering skills include designing amplification circuits using field effect and bipolar transistors, analyzing analog systems, designing basic radio systems, analyzing transmission lines, and much more. In addition, I am highly proficient in C++ and it's use object in object oriented programming. I am also well versed in Python as it's use as a calculating tool for engineers in order to automate repetitive and tedious tasks, as well as its ability to create useful and fun projects relatively quickly due to its extensive packages and libraries.

Website File Downloader
</h3><p>
The website file downloader is a simple project that I built out of necessity. Browsing through my professor's class pages, I found that a single page had many notes and resources that would be too tedious to download on their own. With this app, this process is automated, and the downloads are all stored neatly in a separate folder in the User's Downloads folder.

Twitter and Instagram Weather Bot for College Station
</h3><p>
This weather bot automatically gathers weather information about College Station, Texas, creates an image and text with the data, and posts them to Twitter and Instagram! It is run on my personal raspberry pi 24/7, posting intermittently without any user input.
