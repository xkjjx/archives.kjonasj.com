      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Today, I read through sections (if you can call it that) one through fifteen of the book. I already read it before, but I was&#xA;surprised at the amount of new insight I was able to gain when I read it again. I took notes in my notebook. My notes include&#xA;summaries, as well as my own analysis. To maintain the value of this read, I will only include my own analysis and give context&#xA;when needed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
