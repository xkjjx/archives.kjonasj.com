      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi, I am Kevin Johnson, a Senior Computer Engineering Major from Texas A&amp;amp;M University. I am interested in making the biggest impact on&#xA;the world and I am constantly looking for ways to achieve this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;College has potential to be an extremely transformative growth period in a lot of people’s lives. This certainly rang true for me,&#xA;because at Texas A&amp;amp;M University I’ve had several opportunities that developed me as a leader and problem solver. My involvement in&#xA;student organizations has given me opportunities to engage in several high-impact students that affect students all across Texas A&amp;amp;M&#xA;University. In addition, I also got to learn how much of an impact I can make through software and how fun developing mastery over&#xA;such a powerful tool is. I hope to utilize these leadership, interpersonal, and technical skills to help make the world a&#xA;better place.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Amazon Summer Internship 2024</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The period of time when I learned the most about Software Engineering was last summer, when I interned with Amazon. Since I believe in&#xA;high-impact ventures, I was extremely happy to play a huge role in ensuring an efficient transportation system for Amazon. With that&#xA;being said, there were several factors that made  this internship much more challenging than a typical Amazon internship.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, I was expected to communicate with the product manager, who I was building the internal tool for, and an internatinal team&#xA;based out of India, who had the most up-to-date technical knowledge regarding this internal tool, in order to come up with a perfect&#xA;solution that improved Amazon’s business. I also was given an unique opportunity to build something from the ground up, meaning a lot&#xA;of advanced infrastructure set up regarding build systems, pipelines, etc. had to be handled by me. My mentor was also based out of&#xA;India, so I was also forced to research documentation and talk to others in order to come up with solutions on my own a lot of times.&#xA;I was also in the depths of Java and OOP, and this forced me to think a lot about code structure and how it is best done to ensure the&#xA;systems we build are the most maintainable and expandable. I saw OOP as not just a silly example in class, but rather as an actual&#xA;tool, that when used properly, helps manage complexity by developing abstractions that the next level can afford to not worry about.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
