    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p><p>Hi, I am Kevin Johnson, a Senior Computer Engineering Major from Texas A&amp;M University. I am interested in making the biggest impact on
the world and I am constantly looking for ways to achieve this.</p>
<p>College has potential to be an extremely transformative growth period in a lot of people’s lives. This certainly rang true for me,
because at Texas A&amp;M University I’ve had several opportunities that developed me as a leader and problem solver. My involvement in
student organizations has given me opportunities to engage in several high-impact students that affect students all across Texas A&amp;M
University. In addition, I also got to learn how much of an impact I can make through software and how fun developing mastery over
such a powerful tool is. I hope to utilize these leadership, interpersonal, and technical skills to help make the world a
better place.</p>
